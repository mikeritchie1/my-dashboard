# Dashboard + Scrapers

This project now has:
- `services/` for scraper/service code
- `docs/` for frontend files
- `data/` as the single source of runtime data (no duplicate copies)

## Structure

- [services/events](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/services/events): events and specials scrapers
- [services/media](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/services/media): media/watchlist scraper
- [services/one_piece](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/services/one_piece): One Piece card scraping and change detection
- [services/release_radar](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/services/release_radar): release/coming-soon scrapers
- [docs/index.html](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/docs/index.html): dashboard page
- [docs/app.js](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/docs/app.js): dashboard logic
- [docs/styles.css](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/docs/styles.css): dashboard styles
- [data/events](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/data/events): events + specials JSON
- [data/media](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/data/media): media/watchlist JSON + caches

- [data/release_radar](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/data/release_radar): release JSON
- [data/metadata.json](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/data/metadata.json): last scrape timestamp
- [tests](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/tests): manual test scripts

## Config

All configuration is in [env.py](C:/Users/mjrit/OneDrive/Desktop/one-piece-scraper/env.py).
Scrapers import variables directly from that file.

## Run

Run all scraper groups:

```powershell
python run_local_dashboard_update.py all
```

Run one group:

```powershell
python run_local_dashboard_update.py media
python run_local_dashboard_update.py events
python run_local_dashboard_update.py cards
python run_local_dashboard_update.py digest
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs the dashboard scrapers every day and sends one digest email after the data refresh. The digest compares each scraper section with the previous committed snapshot in `.scrape/daily_digest/`.

Serve dashboard:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8080
```

Open:

`http://localhost:8080/docs/`

## Notes

- There is no data mirroring to docs anymore.
- Dashboard reads directly from `../data/...` paths.
- `.md` and `.txt` report outputs were removed where unused.
